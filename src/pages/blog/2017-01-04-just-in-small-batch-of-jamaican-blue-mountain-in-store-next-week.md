This is my first attempts writing a blog, and in this first post I would like to explain the main goals of this blog and the main topics I will talk about.

## What topics I will talk about?
As I said, the general topic of this blog is coding.

The main coding languages I'm studying are JavaScript and PHP. About JavaScript, other than the language by itself, I'm very interested in the React library and the framework Gatsby. Regarding PHP, I'm mainly interested in its use in many CMS like WordPress and in frameworks like Laravel.

Of course, I will write also about CSS and HTML, since they represent a sort of foundation in web development.

## So, why this blog?

Well, the main reason I decided to start this blog as an help to my efforts in learning coding.

Basically, I think that to actually learn to do coding, it is not enough to just study some manuals or tutorials and put into practice what you've been learned in some projects. These steps are certainly important, but it is equally important to try to explain what you've been learned as clearly as possible.

Another reason is that I would like to have a sort of reference of what I have learned, so if I need to recheck some arguments in a later time, I can search that in this blog.

Finally, I hope that these notes of mine can be of some help to other people who are studying coding, as well as countless blog posts have been useful to me (and continue to be so) in studying coding.
